;; ### Studies

(def interval-groups (parse ex-input))

(filter intervals-contained? interval-groups)


;; ### Observations
;; - which contains which is irrelevant
;; - could be done with set operations but maybe too inefficient

;; ## Part 2

  [input]
  (->> input
       parse
       (filter intervals-overlap?)
       count))

;; ### Studies

(filter intervals-overlap? interval-groups)

;; ### Observations
;; - the number of overlapping sections doesnâ€™t matter
